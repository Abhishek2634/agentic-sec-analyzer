# Agentic SEC Analyzer

An agentic AI platform to analyze SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K). This project uses a multi-agent system with LangChain to generate summaries, extract financial KPIs, identify risks, and answer questions about the filings. The application is built with a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.

This project was developed to fulfill the "Agentic AI Platform for SEC Filings Analysis" assignment.

**Frontend (Vercel):** [https://your-agentic-sec-analyzer.vercel.app](https://your-agentic-sec-analyzer.vercel.app)  
**Backend (Render):** [https://your-sec-analyzer-backend.onrender.com](https://your-sec-analyzer-backend.onrender.com)

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Filing Support:** Analyze annual (10-K), quarterly (10-Q), and material event (8-K) reports for any publicly traded US company.
-   **AI-Powered Analysis:** A team of specialized AI agents works in parallel to:
    -   Generate a high-level **Executive Summary**.
    -   Extract key **Financial KPIs** (Total Revenue, Net Income, EPS) for 10-K/10-Q filings.
    -   Identify and list the top **Risk Factors** from 10-K/10-Q filings.
-   **Interactive Q&A:** A chat interface powered by a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline allows you to ask specific questions about the filing content.
-   **Modern Frontend:** A clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Downloadable Reports:** Export the complete analysis as a structured JSON file.
-   **Optimized Performance:** The backend leverages `asyncio` to run independent AI agent calls concurrently, significantly reducing report generation time.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.0 or later)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.10 or later)
-   [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (Recommended for managing Python environments)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-sec-analyzer.git
    cd agentic-sec-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create and activate a conda environment
    conda create --name sec-analyzer-env python=3.10
    conda activate sec-analyzer-env

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Create a .env file in the 'backend' directory
    touch .env
    ```
    Add your API keys to the `.env` file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    SEC_API_KEY="your_sec-api.io_key_here"
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd ../frontend

    # Install npm packages
    npm install

    # Create a .env.local file in the 'frontend' directory
    touch .env.local
    ```
    Add the local backend URL to your `.env.local` file:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

### Running the Application

You'll need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```
    # In terminal 1, navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend
    conda activate sec-analyzer-env
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Server:**
    ```
    # In terminal 2, navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to use the application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment:

-   The **Frontend** can be deployed to **Vercel** by importing the GitHub repository and setting the root directory to `frontend`.
-   The **Backend** can be deployed to **Render** as a Web Service, setting the root directory to `backend` and using `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` as the start command.

Remember to set the necessary environment variables in your deployment platforms.
